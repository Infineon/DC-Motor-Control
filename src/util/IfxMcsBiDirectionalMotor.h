/*
 *	Arduino library to control Infineons DC Motor Control Shield with BTN8982
 *
 *	The shield contains two independent halfbridges, 
 *	so it can drive two unidirectional or one bidirectional DC motor(s). 
 *	Each halfbridge provides a high-Voltage (nominal 8-18 V) and high-Current (max 30 A due to limited power dissipation) tristate output,  
 *	which is also capable of high frequency PWM. 
 *	There are also two analog diagnostic outputs which indicate the temperature of both BTN8982
 *
 *	Have a look at the datasheet for more information.
